00:49:01.922 A PostCSS plugin did not pass the `from` option to `postcss.parse`. This may cause imported assets to be incorrectly transformed. If you've recently added a PostCSS plugin that raised this warning, please contact the package author to fix the issue.

00:49:09.625 (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
00:49:09.625 - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
00:49:09.625 - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
00:49:09.625 - Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.[39m
